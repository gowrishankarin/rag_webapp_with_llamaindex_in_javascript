Rule 1 - God & You
How we see God is a direct reflection of how we see ourselves. If God brings to mind mostly fear and blame, it means there is too much fear and blame welled inside us. If we see God as full of love and compassion, so are we.
– Shams to the innkeeper

This saying is like a divine personality test: if God has you sweating and pointing fingers, it’s a sign you’ve got a personal fear and blame factory working overtime in your soul. On the flip side, if you see God as the ultimate cosmic hug-giver, congratulations – you’ve probably got a heart full of love and compassion, and your spiritual selfie is all rainbows and warm fuzzies. So, in heavenly terms, it’s less about finding God and more about discovering if you’ve accidentally created a divine mirror reflecting your emotional closet.

Rule 2
The path to the Truth is a labour of the heart, not of the head. Make your heart your primary guide! Not your mind. Meet, challenge and ultimately prevail over your nafs with your heart. Knowing your ego will lead you to the knowledge of God.
– Shams, to himself

Embarking on the Truth train is less of a brainy expedition and more of a cardio workout for your heart muscles. Forget about your noggin; let your heart take the driver’s seat. Wrestle with your nafs (inner desires and ego) using heartfelt moves – it’s like a soulful wrestling match. Once you’ve pinned down your ego, voila! You’ve just unlocked the divine cheat code to God-level knowledge. It’s basically heart over head, folks – your ticker is the real MVP on this quest for wisdom!

Rule 3
You can study God through everything and everyone in the universe, because God is not confined in a mosque, synagogue or church. But if you are still in need of knowing where exactly His abode is, there is only one place to look for him: in the heart of a true lover.
– Shams, to the judge

Think of God like a hide-and-seek champion – you won’t find Him just chilling in a fancy building. Nope, He’s everywhere, playing peekaboo in the entire universe. But, if you’re on a divine scavenger hunt and want the GPS coordinates to His secret lair, spoiler alert: it’s in the heart of someone who’s head over heels in love. Forget about Google Maps; true love is the ultimate divine hotspot. So, if you’re searching for God, ditch the map and follow the trail of heart-shaped breadcrumbs. Just be careful not to trip over the butterflies along the way.

Rule 4
Intellect and love are made of different materials. Intellect ties people in knots and risks nothing, but love dissolves all tangles and risks everything. Intellect is always cautious and advices, ‘Beware too much ecstasy’, whereas love says, ‘Oh, never mind! Take the plunge!’ Intellect does not easily break down, whereas love can effortlessly reduce itself to rubble. But treasures are hidden among ruins. A broken heart hides treasures.
– Shams, to Baba Zaman

Picture intellect as a meticulous architect, meticulously planning and cautioning, “Watch out for too much excitement!” Meanwhile, love is the carefree artist, throwing caution to the wind, yelling, “Dive in, who cares!” Intellect is like a fortress – sturdy and unyielding – always on guard. Love, on the other hand, is a bit of a demolition expert, happily turning itself into a romantic wreck. Sure, love might leave you in ruins, but guess what? That’s where the treasures, aka hidden heart bling, are stashed. So, while intellect is busy giving safety tips, love is out there doing cannonballs into the pool of life, creating a beautiful mess along the way.

Rule 5
Most of problems of the world stem from linguistic mistakes and simple misunderstanding. Don’t ever take words at face value. When you step into the zone of love, language, as we know it becomes obsolete. That which cannot be put into words can only be grasped through silence.
– Shams, to Baba Zaman

Imagine the world as a giant game of telephone, but instead of giggles, we’ve got global issues. The root cause? Linguistic mix-ups and people misinterpreting each other like charades gone wrong. The advice here? Don’t trust words – they’re the ultimate tricksters. Now, when you waltz into the love arena, brace yourself because language decides to take a coffee break. It’s like, “Sorry, folks, I’m outta here!” Love becomes a silent movie, and anything too epic for words can only be understood through the language of hush-hush. So, next time someone hands you a dictionary, just toss it into the love zone and watch it vanish like a magician’s rabbit. Silly words, love speaks in silence!

Rule 6
Loneliness and solitude are two different things. When you are lonely, it is easy to delude yourself into believing that you are on the right path. Solitude is better for us, as it means being alone without feeling lonely. But eventually it is the best to find a person who will be your mirror. Remember only in another person’s heart can you truly see yourself and the presence of God within you.
– Shams, to Baba Zaman(his inner voice)

Alright, imagine loneliness as that clingy friend who won’t leave you alone, whispering, “You’re doing great, buddy!” even when you’re lost in the wilderness of life. Now, solitude, on the other hand, is the solo vacation you didn’t know you needed – being alone but feeling like a total boss. But wait for it, the real jackpot is finding a partner who’s your mirror – not just for those epic selfie moments, but because in her heart, you discover the divine GPS that points straight to the real you and a cosmic “You Are Here” sign pointing to the presence of God. Turns out, the best company is the one that helps you locate yourself on the celestial map while also laughing at your terrible jokes. Who knew self-discovery could be this amusing?

Rule 7
Whatever happens in your life, no matter how troubling things might seem, do not enter the neighbourhood of despair. Even when all doors remain closed, God will open up a new path only for you. Be thankful! It is easy to be thankful when all is well. A Sufi is thankful not only for what he has been given but also for all that he has been denied.
– Shams, to himself

Think of life as a sitcom. Even when the plot twists seem like the writers ran out of ideas and slammed all the doors shut, fear not! God is the ultimate showrunner, and just when you think you’re stuck in reruns, bam! A brand-new path opens up, like a surprise season drop. Now, gratitude – that’s the real twist in the plot. It’s easy when life’s a rom-com, but here’s the Sufi twist: being thankful not just for the fancy gifts but also for the times when life hands you a plot twist and says, “Sorry, that’s a hard pass.” It’s like being grateful for the “plot holes” because, let’s face it, they make life one heck of an unpredictable sitcom. So, next time life feels like a confusing episode, remember, it’s just building up to the grand finale – you know, the one with the big reveal and unexpected laughter.

Rule 8
Patience does not mean to passively endure. It means to look at the end of a process. What does patience mean? It means to look at the thorn and see the rose, to look at the night and see the dawn. Impatience means to be shortsighted as to not be able to see the outcome. The lovers of God never run out of patience, for they know that time is needed for the crescent moon to become full.
– Shams, to himself

Alright, patience is not just sitting there twiddling your thumbs – it’s like having X-ray vision for the grand finale. Picture this: patience is not staring at a thorn and going, “Ouch!” Instead, it’s like having a superhero ability to see the rose that’s about to bloom right next to it. Impatience, well, that’s just being nearsighted, missing the big picture like a superhero without their glasses.

Now, lovers of God are basically time wizards. They’re the Gandalfs of the spiritual realm, understanding that it takes a bit for the crescent moon of life to go full disco ball. So, next time you’re feeling impatient, just imagine yourself with a Gandalf beard, telling time to chill because the real magic is just around the corner. Time might be a slowpoke, but hey, even the turtle won the race against the hare, right? Patience, my friend, it’s the superpower you never knew you needed!

Rule 9
East, west, south, or north makes little difference. No matter what your destination, just be sure to make every journey a journey within. If you travel within, you’ll travel the whole wide world and beyond.
– Shams, to himself

Imagine you’re on a quest for the ultimate snack – whether it’s in the east, west, south, or north, it doesn’t matter. The real magic is not in the destination but in the journey. Now, this isn’t your typical road trip; it’s more like a snack hunt within yourself. Picture it: you’re not just munching on chips; you’re nibbling on the mysteries of your soul.

So, the next time you’re stuck in traffic or delayed at an airport, don’t stress. You’re not late; you’re just taking a detour through the depths of your own awesomeness. It’s like a journey within is the ultimate travel hack – forget the passport; pack some introspection! You might not get a stamp in your physical passport, but your soul’s collection will be out of this world. Bon appétit, fellow snack hunter!

Rule 10
The midwife knows that when there is no pain, the way for the baby cannot be opened and the mother cannot give birth. Likewise, for a new self to be born, hardship is necessary. Just as clay needs to go through intense heat to become strong, Love can only be perfected in pain.
– Shams, to himself

Think of life as a cosmic maternity ward. The midwife, who’s basically the universe’s delivery expert, knows the drill. No pain, no baby – it’s like the universe’s way of saying, “Sorry, gotta feel the squeeze to make an entrance!”

Now, your personal rebirth, your “new self” – that’s like upgrading to the deluxe version of you. But guess what? Hardship is the rite of passage. It’s the universe’s way of giving you a makeover – a bit like putting clay in a spa, but instead of cucumber slices, it’s intense heat. Love, in this scenario, is the ultimate beauty treatment, and it apparently comes with a bit of pain. So, the next time life feels like it’s turning up the heat, just think of it as the universe giving you a spa day for your soul – and hey, who said makeovers were painless, right?

Rule 11 - Seeker
The quest for love changes user. There is no seeker among those who search for love who has not matured on the way. The moment you start looking for love, you start to change within and without.
– Shams, to himself

Imagine the quest for love as a cosmic app – it’s like Tinder for the soul. So, when you hit that search button for love, it’s not just about finding a cosmic match; it’s about a whole system upgrade. No one escapes this love-seeking journey without a bit of soul maturation. It’s like the universe is saying, “Oh, you want love? Buckle up, buttercup, because we’re taking you on a ride – both inside and outside.”

So, next time you’re on the lookout for love, don’t be surprised if you suddenly feel wiser and maybe even start using words like “maturation.” It’s the glow-up that comes with the territory. The quest for love is not just about finding someone to share memes with; it’s about evolving into the upgraded version of yourself. Happy love hunting, fellow explorers! May your soul find its perfect match!

Rule 12
There are more fake gurus and false teachers in this world than the number of stars in the visible universe. Don’t confuse power-driven, self-centered people with true mentors. A genuine spiritual master will not direct your attention to himself or herself and will not expect absolute obedience or utter admiration from you, but instead will help you to appreciate and admire your inner self. True mentors are as transparent as glass. They let the light of God pass through them.
Shams, to Baba Zaman

Imagine the world is a giant talent show, and everywhere you look, there are more fake gurus and self-proclaimed life coaches than there are stars in the night sky. It’s like everyone’s got a life advice booth, and some are just in it for the glittery cape and spotlight.

Now, here’s the pro tip: don’t mistake the drama queens for the real deal. True mentors aren’t the ones with power-hungry vibes; they’re more like the spiritual sidekicks, the Gandalfs without the pointy hats. They’re not there to hog the stage or demand applause; they’re basically as transparent as glass – no smoke, no mirrors, just good vibes.

So, the next time someone claims to have the secret to the universe, just remember: real mentors don’t block your view; they’re more like the Windex, helping you see your inner awesomeness clearly. Because let’s face it, in this talent show, it’s the real, transparent mentors who let the light of God pass through – no need for flashy fireworks or magic tricks!

Rule 13
Try not to resist the changes, which come your way. Instead let life live through you. And do not worry that your life is turning upside down. How do you know that the side you are used to is better than the one to come?
– Shams, to a novice

Think of life as a acrobat doing somersaults – sometimes it feels like it’s turning your world upside down. Now, the universe says, “Chill, my friend, and let life do its thing through you.” It’s like being the passenger in the wildest rollercoaster, and you’re not even sure if you’re on the right side up.

So, the next time life throws you a curveball, just imagine it’s the universe’s way of testing your acrobatic skills. Who knows, maybe upside down is the new right side up, and the universe is just trying out a funky dance move. Remember, resisting change is like telling the DJ to stick to the same old song – where’s the fun in that? So, embrace the chaos, and who knows, you might just discover your inner acrobat is a secret breakdancer! Life’s a wild ride; might as well dance through the twists and turns!

Rule 14
God is busy with the completion of your work, both outwardly and inwardly. He is fully occupied with you. Every human being is a work in progress that is slowly but inexorably moving toward perfection. We are each an unfinished work of art both waiting and striving to be completed. God deals with each of us separately because humanity is fine art of skilled penmanship where every single dot is equally important for the entire picture.
– Shams, to himself

Imagine God as the ultimate multitasker, juggling to-do lists for every person on Earth. It’s like He’s your personal project manager, working on your masterpiece both on the surface and deep within. You’re basically God’s ongoing art project, and He’s the ultimate artist, totally absorbed in crafting your epic saga.

Now, here’s the twist: we’re all masterpieces in the making, like God’s own collection of evolving doodles. He’s so into it that He’s dealing with each of us individually, like a meticulous artist obsessed with every tiny detail. It’s like we’re part of this grand masterpiece, and every dot in the divine doodle is crucial.

So, the next time you feel like life is a bit chaotic, just remember, God’s in His studio, paintbrush in one hand, divine coffee in the other, working on your epic portrait. You’re not a rough draft; you’re a work of art in progress – a masterpiece with a touch of humor. Keep being your unique dot in the grand canvas of humanity!

Rule 15
It’s easy to love a perfect God, unblemished and infallible that He is. What is far more difficult is to love fellow human being with all their imperfections and defects. Remember, one can only know what one is capable of loving. There is no wisdom without love. Unless we learn to love God’s creation, we can neither truly love nor truly know God.
– Shams, to a peasant

Think of it like having a crush on a superhero – loving a perfect God is a breeze because, well, He’s flawless, like a divine Marvel character. Now, switch gears to your fellow humans; it’s like trying to love a bunch of quirky side characters with their own unique set of imperfections. It’s a bit like choosing between a superhero with a sleek costume and one with a cape made of mismatched socks.

Now, here’s the plot twist: you can only truly love what you understand. It’s like trying to appreciate the complexities of superhero backstories – you won’t get it unless you’re a fan. So, if you want the ultimate superhero wisdom, start by embracing the quirks and imperfections of your fellow humans. It’s the prerequisite for joining the ultimate fan club – loving and understanding God. Because, let’s face it, even superheroes have their off days, and love is the ultimate fan club pass. Suit up, embrace the quirks, and get ready for the premiere!
